# sd2xmltv

sd2xmltv is an application written in Python to convert Schedules Direct (schedulesdirect.org) TV schedules JSON feed into an xmltv format.  This application was written primarily to facilitate importing TV schedules into tvheadend with Kodi (XBMC) as a frontend.  While the primary target is tvheadend, the output file should work in any application which can parse xmltv.xml files.

Show descriptions are massaged to display like so:

"Simprovised" • Series; New; S27E21; TVPG • Homer embarrasses himself while trying to read a speech at work, then turns to improv comedy to regain his confidence for public speaking; Marge decides to rebuild Bart's treehouse.

However, the pressure of living as an adult begins to overwhelm him, and he longs to return to his simple, former life as a boy. •  See also: Elf, 13 Going on 30, Freaky Friday

## Installation

For Kodi addon instructions, see README in the /kodi folder.

### Installation for TVHeadend

These instructions are specific for TVHeadend users, but hopefully can help out other users as well.

1. Configure TVHeadend to listen on a socket for xmltv (typically stored in `/home/hts/.hts/tvheadend/epggrab/xmltv.sock`)
2. Unzip or `git clone {url}` into folder accessible to the `hts` user.
3. `chmod +x sd2xmltv.pl`
4. Configure sd2xmltv (NOTE currently only works for US users):
 
 ```
./sd2xmltv.py -u {USERNAME} -p {PASSWORD} -m
 ```
5. Create script which runs listings update regularly:
 ```
!/bin/bash
SRC=/home/hts/sd2xmltv/xmltv.xml
SOCKET=/home/hts/.hts/tvheadend/epggrab/xmltv.sock
EMAIL={EMAILADDR}
USERNAME={USERNAME}
PASSWORD={PASSWORD}

echo "Updating listings" | mail -s "PVR updating" $EMAIL

cd /home/hts/sd2xmltv/
OUTPUT=$(./sd2xmltv.py -u $USERNAME -p $PASSWORD -i 2>&1)

if [ -s $SRC ];
then
	cat $SRC | socat stdin UNIX-CONNECT:$SOCKET
fi

echo $OUTPUT | mail -s "PVR updated" $EMAIL
 ```
6. Make script executable `chmod +x {SCRIPT}`
7. Install this script in the `hts` user's crontab `crontab -e`
8. Execute script and ensure output is as expected
